## Description:
This folder includes a total of four sub folders titled (i) 1_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS, (ii) 2_CLOUD_FREE_DATASET, (iii) 3_CLOUDY_DATASET and (iv) 4_TRAINING_MASKS. 


## Keywords:
JUPYTER NOTEBOOKE, CLOUD_FREE_DATASET, CLOUDY_DATASET, TRAINING MASKS


## This dataset contains the following folders:
1. 1_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS 
2. 2_CLOUD_FREE_DATASET
3. 3_CLOUDY_DATASET
4. 4_TRAINING_MASKS


## Explanation of variables:
1. Firstly, the "1_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS" folder includes six jupyter notebooks, three for Cloudy dataset (inside the folder 1_CLOUD_FREE_DATASET) and three for Cloudy Free Dataset (inside the folder 2_CLOUDY_DATASET). 
2. Secondly, the "2_CLOUD_FREE_DATASET" folder includes the Sentinel-1 dataset dated 22nd July 2020 and Sentinel-2 dataset dated 27th July 2020.
3. Thirdly, the "3_CLOUDY_DATASET" folder includes the Sentinel-1 dataset dated 26th October 2020 and Sentinel-2 dataset dated 25th October 2020.
4. Fourthly, the "4_TRAINING_MASKS" folder incldes the Ground Truth Dataset (derived from PRODES), in rasterized format for training the Deep Learning model.



## Methods, materials and software:
1. METHOD: SEGNET
2. MATERIALS: SENTINEL-1, SENTINEL-2 AND PRODES DEFORESTATION DATASET
2. SOFTWARE: GOOGLE COLAB PRO+
